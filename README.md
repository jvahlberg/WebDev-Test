# YouChoose

## Description:
Sometimes people have trouble choosing when faced with multiple options.  For example, deciding where to go out for dinner can become an unpleasant ordeal because no one can agree on one restaurant.  This project will be a web utility that helps people pick from multiple options at random.  The users will be able to enter a list of any number of things, then press a button and the application will choose and display one of the items.  We often have the most trouble choosing from sets of options that we have to choose from regularly as well, so this application will also allow the user to save their lists and use them again later.

## Installation
To install, clone the repository.  Then navigate to the "you-choose" folder in a terminal.  Run "npm install" and then "npm start" and the app will open in a browser window.

## Usage
- Add a list of choices (each item on a new line) in the text area on the left side of the app.  When you have added all the choices, click the button in the middle of the screen to pick one of them at random.\
- Account log in / creation is stubbed out at the moment, not fully functional.\
- List management is also rudimentary.  Two sample lists are available.  Can create a named list that will appear in the selector, but it is non-functional.

## Contributing
To add to this code, edit index.js and index.css as necessary.
